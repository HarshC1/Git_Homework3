## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(rstudioapi)                  # This is a external library of functions
library(rlang)                       # To support tidyverse dplyr library
library(magrittr)                    # To support tidyverse dplyr library
library(dplyr)                       # To manipulate and clean data frames
library(class)                       # To run KNN model
library(car)
library(ISLR)
library(caret)
library(pROC)
library(corrplot)
library(glmnet)


```

```{r}
load("transaction.rdata")
